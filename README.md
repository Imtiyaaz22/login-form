# About the Project

This is a simple login page, coded with HTML, SCSS, and Javascript. What I really wanted to incorporate into this project is a colour palette switch functionality. I also wanted to use the localStorage API to store the user preferences.

## What I learnt during this Project

- Using localStorage API
- Building a custom checkbox button
- Adding a theme switcher 
- Through researching, I learnt more about CSS & JavaScript
